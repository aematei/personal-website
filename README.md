# alexmatei.dev

My personal portfolio and blog. Built to be fast, clean, and easy to update.

**Live site:** [alexmatei.dev](https://alexmatei.dev)


## Built with

- Next.js 14 + TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- Markdown for blog posts (gray-matter + remark)
- Deployed on Vercel

## Running locally
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Why I built it this way

I wanted something minimal that I could update quickly without fighting a CMS. Static generation keeps it fast, and writing in Markdown means I can focus on content instead of formatting.

Typography choices: Crimson Text for that literary feel, generous whitespace because I dislike cluttered portfolios.
